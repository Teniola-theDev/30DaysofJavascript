# DAY ONE: _The start of a beautiful journey_

My name is Teniola, this is a decision I have made to myself to make sure I do well enough.

I have few plans for today, but I am grateful that I coded before I went to Twitter

## What I have done.

This is the first session of the day.

- I revised function expression and function declarations.
- I learnt Arrow Functions.
  - I ran into few errors because I am yet to be very comfortable with function declarations.
  - **Way forward:** I will revise it tomorrow and do the coding assignments.

Session two of the day.
I learnt more on functions and now I can declare a function even more.
By the time I'm back, I should go through **Arrays**.

## What I want to have achieved by the end of the day

- Watch the Youtube Video on differences between function declarations and function expressions
- Continue my Technical Writing tutorial.

## Problems

- My arrow function to calculate a number did not return a number
  - I omitted the return keyword.
  - When you use arrow functions, as long as you use curly braces, you must use the return keyword.
