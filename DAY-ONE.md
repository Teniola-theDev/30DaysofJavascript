# DAY ONE: _The start of a beautiful journey_

My name is Teniola, this is a decision I have made to myself to make sure I do well enough.

I have few plans for today, but I am grateful that I coded before I went to Twitter

## What I have done.

#### This is the first session of the day.

- I revised function expression and function declarations.
- I learnt Arrow Functions.
  - I ran into few errors because I am yet to be very comfortable with function declarations.
  - **Way forward:** I will revise it tomorrow and do the coding assignments.

#### **Session two of the day.**
I learnt more on functions and now I can declare a function even more.
By the time I'm back, I should go through **Arrays**.

#### **Session three of the day**
I walked through arrays and I can see that I have a better grasp of arrays overall now.
My laptop is at 20% so I'll be taking a short break for now, and come back for a short session if we don't have light later in the day.
_I am yet to watch the Youtube Video, but I really need to._

## What I want to have achieved by the end of the day

- Watch the Youtube Video on differences between function declarations and function expressions
- Continue my Technical Writing tutorial.

## Problems

- My arrow function to calculate a number did not return a number
  - I omitted the return keyword.
  - When you use arrow functions, as long as you use curly braces, you must use the return keyword.
