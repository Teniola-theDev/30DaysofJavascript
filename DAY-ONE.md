# DAY ONE: _The start of a beautiful journey_

My name is Teniola, this is a decision I have made to myself to make sure I do well enough.

I have few plans for today, but I am grateful that I coded before I went to Twitter

## What I have done.

This is the first session of the day.

- I revised function expression and function declarations.
- I learnt Arrow Functions.
  - I ran into few errors because I am yet to be very comfortable with function declarations.
  - **Way forward:** I will revise it tomorrow and do the coding assignments.

## What I want to have achieved by the end of the day

- Watch the Youtube Video on differences between fnction declarations and function expressions
- Continue my Technical Writing tutorial.
