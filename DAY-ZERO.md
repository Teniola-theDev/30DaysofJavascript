It is with great joy that I flag off this project. While I am doing this right now to procrastinate, I would love to think of it as a beautiful way to gain more experience.

### Compound effects

I saw a quote that said

I don't know if I have a lot of patience to do a 100DaysofCode, but I have the discipline to do a 30DaysOfCode.
I know that by the end of this short challenge, I'd have been a better developer.

I know how much consistency pays. I can see it in the typing skills I have acquired, in the writing skills I have gained.
I can see it in how good my focus has been due to meditation.

I am choosing to stay consistent and work well on my Javascript. I can do it.
