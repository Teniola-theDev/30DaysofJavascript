## WHAT I HAVE DONE

#### Session One

- Learnt about the for loop
- How to loop the for loop backwards
- How to use the continue and break statements.

#### Session Two

#### Session Three

#### Session Four

## PROBLEMS

1. My continue statement refused to work.

   - I tried to declare a continue statement that should loop over an array and skip values that are not strings.
   - The thing is to wrap your strings in quotation marks.

     - ```
       for (let i = 0; i < jonasArray.length; i++) {

       if (typeof jonasArray[i] !== "string") break;
       console.log(`this is ${jonasArray[i]}`);

       }
       ```
