# 30DaysofJavascript

- I will be going through thirty days of the 69 hours JS course I saw on Udemy.
- The goal is to be very consistent.
- I won't commit here on Sundays.
- I hope to have written about 2 articles by the end of this and to have finished at least 20 hours of the course.
- I will be documenting this via a new README file everyday titled with what I learnt.

### New Change

- This should change to 30DaysofCode.
- I want to have improved in my technical writing skills- markdown syntax and overall technical writing knowledge by then. 
- I'll be back to define what makes this count as success.
> Consistency is the goal.

### What determines a successsful run
This will be successful if I finish it in less (or equal to 40 days) from the 21st of June, simply put before 1st of August.
- I am allowed little extension of a week if we resume midway.
- I should have reached the 25th hour mark of the course.
- I should have committed to github at least 25 days of 30.
- I don't code on Sundays- Sundays count as rest days and part of the 30 days.
- I should have finished the pre-class and section one of the Google Technical Writing course.
- Should have written about 2 articles (published on Hashnode.)

### How I would document it.
- I should commit at least once a day using names like **DAY-ONE.md** 
- I should add at least 10 lines.
- I should document what I learnt (if I am able to go into details)
- Something confusing and how I got to understand it.
- Code snippets.
- Quote of the day or something motivational.
- Bible quotes are allowed.
