# 30DaysofJavascript

- I will be going through thirty days of the 69 hours JS course I saw on Udemy.
- The goal is to be very consistent.
- I won't commit here on Sundays.
- I hope to have written about 2 articles by the end of this and to have finished at least 20 hours of the course.
- I will be documenting this via a new README file titled with what I learnt.

### New Change

- This should change to 30DaysofCode.
- I want to have improved in my technical writing skills- markdown syntax and overall technical writing knowledge by then. 
- I'll be back to define what makes this count as success.
> Consistency is the goal.
